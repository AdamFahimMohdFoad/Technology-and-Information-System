## Reflection
From this PC assembly lab, I get to understand more about PC components and how they are assembled and where they are placed inside the PC. 

## Suggestion for Improvements
Provide the participants with the latest model of the PC so that they understand the pcs that are more up to date. 

## Steps to Assemble the PC
1. Install CPU on the Motherboard
2. Install RAM
3. Install Power Supply
4. Insert Hard Disk
5. Connect Wire
6. Put on the PC case
