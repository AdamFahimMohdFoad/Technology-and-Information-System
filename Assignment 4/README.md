Venue: Webex 

## Reflection
The two industry talks from Clarity Techworks and AirAsia gave me a clearer and more practical understanding of the important role ICT plays in modern industries. This includes areas like fintech, travel, and digital technologies. It's not just about programming as I once thought. At Clarity Techworks, I learned how ICT professionals help manage real financial systems using the Internet, mobile applications, blockchain, and web application interfaces. It's all about precision, security, and attentiveness when dealing with financial situations or building trust with users. At AirAsia, we discovered how ICT professionals enable large organizations to shift to digital platforms. They connect various services, such as travel, deliveries, and fintech, under one system. These presentations also motivated me to be a proactive and independent learner. Technology evolves quickly, especially with Web 3 innovations, mobile software development, cloud computing, and data processing. I realized that ICT professionals must regularly upgrade their skills, embrace new tools, and remain relevant in a competitive field. Most importantly, I learned that ICT jobs have real meaning because they address real-world problems, improve efficiency, and enhance experiences for users and businesses worldwide.

## Suggestion For Improvement
 Both of the talks needs to be held offline so the participants of the talk can obtain better input of the talk.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, both of the talks made me more knowleadgeble about the use and importance of technology in making innovations throughout different industries.
