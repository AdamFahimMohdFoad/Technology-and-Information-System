## Reflection 

The design thinking project made me understand on how certain systems or applications can help the users to improve the efficiency of their lives. This project also made me analyse and utilise critical-thinking to solve the problems that the users face in their daily lives. From this project, I learned that developing a system is not easy and requires a lot more than just critical-thinking. It requires analytical skills, strong logical thinking, creativity and much more. I hope to achieve and hone these strong skills in the future so that I can become a successful computer scientist.

## Suggestion for Improvement 

The project needs to be presented in class so that it simulates the project being done and presented in the real-world scenario.
