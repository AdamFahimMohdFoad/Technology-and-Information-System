## Reflection 
From this talk I got to learn about about the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) which consists of 6 phases which are planning, defining, designing, building, testing and finally deployment. He explained it in a very interesting way and that was using the analogy of making the dish Nasi Lemak. During the talk he also emphasized the importance of mastering the basics of computer science so that the SDLC can be executed smoothly. I hope I can learn more about the different concepts of computer science in the future. 

## Suggestions for Improvement 
The talk needs to be held offline so that the participants who attend the talk get to experience real-world industry scenarios.
