## Reflection
Joining the UTM Digital Open Day Program was an exciting experience. During the open day I had the chance to attend a talk given by Mohd Asrul Muhammad Zin where he explained about the Digitech X6 Oracle Academy. He talked about the services and how Oracle Academy can help poeple strengthen their basics in computer science. Besides that, I also had the opportunity to visit several booths but throughout all the booths I visited, one booth that caught my eye was a booth from a company called D-Ron. It was a company that provides scalable video surveillance solutions and vital IT network support. Overall, I enjoyed the visit to UTM Digital and hope to gain more knowledge about the applications of technology in real-world scenarios.

## Suggestion for Improvement 
Group the participants in specific batches and for each batch assign them the specific times so that the venue of the event is not overcrowded
