## Reflection
The Industry Talk held by PPG which was given by the PPG staffs was an amazing opportunity for me to learn how data enhances business efficiency, improves operational effectiveness, and supports better supply chain management. From this session, I learned that using data helps companies make better decisions, reduce mistakes, and improve overall performance. I hope I can learn more about data and further enhance my capabilities as a computer scientist.

## Suggestion for Improvement 
The talk needs to be held offline so that the participants who attend the talk get to experience real-world industry scenarios.
