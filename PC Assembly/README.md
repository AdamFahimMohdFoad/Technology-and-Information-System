## Reflection
From this PC assembly lab, I get to understand more about PC components and how they are assembled and where they are placed inside the PC.

## Suggestion for Improvements
Provide the participants with the latest model of the PC so that they understand the pcs that are more up to date.

## Steps to Assemble the PC
Install CPU on the Motherboard
Install RAM
Install Power Supply
Insert Hard Disk
Connect Wire
Put on the PC case
